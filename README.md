## :wrench: Dependencies and Installation

- Python >= 3.7 (Recommend to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
- [PyTorch >= 1.7](https://pytorch.org/)
- Option: NVIDIA GPU + [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
- Option: Linux

### Installation

We now provide a *clean* version of GFPGAN, which does not require customized CUDA extensions. <br>
If you want to use the original model in our paper, please see [PaperModel.md](PaperModel.md) for installation.

1. Clone repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN.git
    cd GFPGAN
    ```

1. Install dependent packages

    ```bash
    # Install basicsr - https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR
    # We use BasicSR for both training and inference
    pip install basicsr

    # Install facexlib - https://github.com/xinntao/facexlib
    # We use face detection and face restoration helper in the facexlib package
    pip install facexlib

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py develop

    # If you want to enhance the background (non-face) regions with Real-ESRGAN,
    # you also need to install the realesrgan package
    pip install realesrgan
    ```

## :zap: Quick Inference

We take the v1.3 version for an example. More models can be found [here](#european_castle-model-zoo).

Download pre-trained models: [GFPGANv1.3.pth](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v1.3.0/GFPGANv1.3.pth)

```bash
wget https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v1.3.0/GFPGANv1.3.pth -P experiments/pretrained_models
```

**Inference!**

```bash
python inference_gfpgan.py -i inputs/whole_imgs -o results -v 1.3 -s 2
```

```console
Usage: python inference_gfpgan.py -i inputs/whole_imgs -o results -v 1.3 -s 2 [options]...

  -h                   show this help
  -i input             Input image or folder. Default: inputs/whole_imgs
  -o output            Output folder. Default: results
  -v version           GFPGAN model version. Option: 1 | 1.2 | 1.3. Default: 1.3
  -s upscale           The final upsampling scale of the image. Default: 2
  -bg_upsampler        background upsampler. Default: realesrgan
  -bg_tile             Tile size for background sampler, 0 for no tile during testing. Default: 400
  -suffix              Suffix of the restored faces
  -only_center_face    Only restore the center face
  -aligned             Input are aligned faces
  -ext                 Image extension. Options: auto | jpg | png, auto means using the same extension as inputs. Default: auto
```

If you want to use the original model in our paper, please see [PaperModel.md](PaperModel.md) for installation and inference.

| Version | Model Name  | Description |
| :---: | :---:        |     :---:      |
| V1.3 | [GFPGANv1.3.pth](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v1.3.0/GFPGANv1.3.pth) | Based on V1.2; **more natural** restoration results; better results on very low-quality / high-quality inputs. |
| V1.2 | [GFPGANCleanv1-NoCE-C2.pth](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v0.2.0/GFPGANCleanv1-NoCE-C2.pth) | No colorization; no CUDA extensions are required. Trained with more data with pre-processing. |
| V1 | [GFPGANv1.pth](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v0.1.0/GFPGANv1.pth) | The paper model, with colorization. |

The comparisons are in [Comparisons.md](Comparisons.md).

Note that V1.3 is not always better than V1.2. You may need to select different models based on your purpose and inputs.

| Version | Strengths  | Weaknesses |
| :---: | :---:        |     :---:      |
|V1.3 |  ✓ natural outputs<br> ✓better results on very low-quality inputs <br> ✓ work on relatively high-quality inputs <br>✓ can have repeated (twice) restorations | ✗ not very sharp <br> ✗ have a slight change on identity |
|V1.2 |  ✓ sharper output <br> ✓ with beauty makeup | ✗ some outputs are unnatural |

You can find **more models (such as the discriminators)** here: [[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17rLiFzcUMoQuhLnptDsKolegHWwJOnHu?usp=sharing)], OR [[Tencent Cloud 腾讯微云](https://share.weiyun.com/ShYoCCoc)]

## :computer: Training

We provide the training codes for GFPGAN (used in our paper). <br>
You could improve it according to your own needs.

**Tips**

1. More high quality faces can improve the restoration quality.
2. You may need to perform some pre-processing, such as beauty makeup.

**Procedures**

(You can try a simple version ( `options/train_gfpgan_v1_simple.yml`) that does not require face component landmarks.)

1. Dataset preparation: [FFHQ](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset)

1. Download pre-trained models and other data. Put them in the `experiments/pretrained_models` folder.
    1. [Pre-trained StyleGAN2 model: StyleGAN2_512_Cmul1_FFHQ_B12G4_scratch_800k.pth](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v0.1.0/StyleGAN2_512_Cmul1_FFHQ_B12G4_scratch_800k.pth)
    1. [Component locations of FFHQ: FFHQ_eye_mouth_landmarks_512.pth](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v0.1.0/FFHQ_eye_mouth_landmarks_512.pth)
    1. [A simple ArcFace model: arcface_resnet18.pth](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v0.1.0/arcface_resnet18.pth)

1. Modify the configuration file `options/train_gfpgan_v1.yml` accordingly.

1. Training

> python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=22021 gfpgan/train.py -opt options/train_gfpgan_v1.yml --launcher pytorch
